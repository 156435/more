Since it's the last meeting of the year, we're having a pizza party! Here's what we're going to be doing today:

-   Eating pizza!
-   Getting everyone on the same track. Pretty soon I'm going to forget what everybody is doing, so I'm going to get everyone set up with [this]() walkthrough so that everyone is signed up on Slack, knows what Hack Club is, etc.
-   Let's build a New Year's card together! Everyone's going to get a different part, and we're going to deploy it by the end of the meeting.
